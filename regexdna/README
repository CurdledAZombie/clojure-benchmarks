There isn't a whole lot that is Clojure-specific to this test -- most
of it is exercising the Java regular expression libraries, although
with Clojure-specific interfaces to them.

I'm surprised that regexdna.clj-1.clj is noticeably faster than
regexdna.clj-2.clj.  Perhaps using a function as the second arg to
re-gsub is significantly slower?
