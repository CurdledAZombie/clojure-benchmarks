Added some Clojure programs for the reverse-complement benchmark.  See
rcomp/README for some memory issues I'm still trying to solve.

Found a significant speedup for the Clojure program for the
k-nucleotide problem.  Lesson: If you want to use the same constant
map like a function many times, assign it to a Var once, and let-bind
it where it is used to a name.  Don't just have the map there in the
first element of a form -- Clojure will recreate a new map each time
before calling it.
