Source files related to the STREAM benchmark, described further on
this web page:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subdirectory c-original:

stream-original.c is the original C source code I obtained from the
STREAM benchmarks web page.  The other files in there are also from
that web page, except stream-modified.c, which is identical to
stream-original.c except for the array size used in the test.  I made
it larger to ensure that they would come nowhere near to fitting in
any of the caches on my computers.  It does make the tests take longer
to run, and doesn't really give any different results than smaller
arrays that don't fit in the caches, but at least now I know that from
actual measurements.

Subdirectory java-original:

STREAM-original.java is a program from the Contrib area of the STREAM
benchmarks web site.  It is similar in behavior to stream-original.c
above, except for the following difference that could potentially
cause significant differences in the measurements it reports:

+ The C version, when compiled using OpenMP, explicitly synchronizes
  all parallel threads at the end of running each "kernel" of the test
  (i.e. it synchronizes all threads at the end of running the Copy
  kernel, then again at the end of running the Scale kernel, and the
  Triad kernel, etc.).

+ The Java version from the web site does not do this synchronization
  of threads until they are finished running all of the kernels.  It
  is not necessarily likely, but it is thus possible that one thread
  could finish one kernel and begin the next, while other threads were
  running behind.  The measurements thus obtained would be for a mix
  of some threads running one kernel while other threads run a
  different one.

See the next subdirectory for a different Java version that eliminates
this difference.

Subdirectory java-syncthreads:

The file STREAM.java corrects the issue mentioned for java-original
above, explicitly synchronizing all parallel Java threads at the end
of each kernel, before starting any thread on the next one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subdirectory c-plus-extra-tests:

stream.c is based upon c-original/stream-original.c above, and adds
these additional kernels:

+ Write
+ Read
+ Scale1

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subdirectory java-syncthreads-plus-extra-tests:

STREAM.java is based upon java-syncthreads/STREAM.java described
above, and adds the same kernels as the ones described for
c-plus-extra-tests/stream.c above.
