This Java version of STREAM is experimental but interesting....

It expects one command-line argument specifying the number of threads.  
The timing is definitely not compliant with the STREAM run rules when running 
more than one thread, but it makes a nice single-threaded test case.

A typical invocation would therefore be:
	java STREAM 1

The file "STREAM.LOG" contains the output for a typical run on an 
Athlon64-based desktop system.
