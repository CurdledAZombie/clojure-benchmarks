iMac specs:

2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (2 cores)
2 GB RAM  667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM
Running Mac OS X 10.6.4

"The Computer Language Benchmarks Game" web site benchmark machine:

Quad-core 2.4Ghz Intel Q6600
4GB RAM
250GB SATA II disk drive
Ubuntu (TM) 9.04 Linux Kernel 2.6.28-11-generic


Times are real / user / sys on my iMac, with the "long" versions of
the tests, unless otherwise stated.  "real" is elapsed time from start
to finish, so if it is significantly less than (user+sys), it is a
sign that the program is using more than one processor core.

When a Clojure benchmark is described as being "5 x java", for
example, it means that the total of the Clojure "user + sys" time is 5
times more than the total of the Java "user + sys" time.

mandelbrot notes:

sbcl version implemented with threads.  I run it with only 1 thread.
I haven't debugged why it produces the wrong output yet.

perl version implemented with threads, but my Perl implementation
doesn't have threads, so I made a slight modification for a 1-thread
version that doesn't use them at all.

There are at least two versions of Java source code on shootout web
site.  I'm using the one that uses threads, not the other one that
avoids using threads.
